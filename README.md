Blog page containing React Calculator for Oboe Reed Price estimate
Within the reed cost calculator babel script insert, I have written a series of controlled inputs using React 
that call various methods onChange. The methods then execute a series of logic based math to multiply or divide user entries into 
the input fields which in turn then provide the user with, among other things, their total labor cost per reed,
totals for their oboe reed materials cost, and total cost with labor included.
